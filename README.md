## 📌 TODO

* [x] Nano 6G support
* [x] Auto-download `.MSE` files
* [x] Upgraded TUI interface
* [ ] GUI (QT / Tkinter) - Soon
* [x] Support both 2012 and 2015 hardware
* [x] macOS support (accidental but works)
* [x] Custom firmware flashing device (not locked to `/dev/sda`)
* [X] Improve detection of iPod revision
* [x] Windows support (BETA)

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* GitHub does **not allow files >100MB**, so `.MSE` files are **not included**
* Script auto-downloads missing firmware files when needed
* Seeing `LIBUSB_ERROR_NO_DEVICE` at the end of flashing is **normal**
* Windows support is **BETA**; Linux/macOS is recommended for reliability
